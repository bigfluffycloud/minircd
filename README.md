# minircd
Anonymity-enhanced IRC server written in C. We plan to support a minimalistic subset of WebIRC protocol (enough to support KiwiIRC client)

This is a very early version of the tree.

Eventually, we will have a small IRC server with builtin
SQLite-based services and support for direct connection from
KiwiIRC HTML5 client.
